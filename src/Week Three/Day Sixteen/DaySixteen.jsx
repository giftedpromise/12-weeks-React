1. Get Familiar with the Styled-components Library
What is Styled-components?

Styled-components is a popular library for styling React components using tagged template literals. It allows you to write actual CSS code within your JavaScript files, scoped to individual components.

Advantages of Styled-components:

Scoped Styles: Each styled component has its own unique class, avoiding global CSS conflicts.
Dynamic Styling: You can easily pass props to your styled components to change styles dynamically.
Maintainable Code: Styled-components help keep styles close to the components they affect, leading to better maintainability.
Theming: It supports theming, which allows you to define a consistent design across your app.
Installation:

Before using styled-components, you need to install it in your project.

npm install styled-components

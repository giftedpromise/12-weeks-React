   Day 5: Context API
Understanding the Context API
The Context API is a React feature that allows you to share state or data across multiple components
 without having to pass props down through each level of the component tree. 
 This is particularly useful for managing global data that needs to be accessed by various 
 parts of your application, such as user authentication status, themes, or language preferences. 
    

 Key Concepts
Context Creation:

React.createContext(): This function is used to create a new context object.
 The context object comes with two components: Provider and Consumer.

 const MyContext = React.createContext();

}
